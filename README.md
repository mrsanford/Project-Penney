# **Project Penney Overview**

This version of Project Penney is a 3-bit implementation. The game works where Player 1 (P1) selects a three card length combination of red and black cards, represented as RED = 0 or BLACK = 1. Player 2 (P2)'s main objective is to maximize wins or minimize loss based on P1's combination.
This is achieved by the following selection methodology: 
- P1 = [1 2 3]
- P2 = [2-inverted, 1 2]
P2's approach to Project Penney is to invert P1's value in the second position, followed by P1's first and second position values in P2's second and third positions, respectively.
